        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>6 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>3 cups crushed cornflake crumbs</li>
            <li>24 chicken wings</li>
            <li>1/2 carrot, cut into thick strips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oil in a large, deep skillet or deep fryer. In a shallow dish or bowl mix together 3/4 cup flour with 2 tablespoons garlic powder; 
                in a second shallow dish or bowl combine eggs and 4 tablespoons garlic powder and mix together. In a third shallow dish or bowl mix together 
                cornflake crumbs, remaining 1/4 cup flour and remaining 2 tablespoons garlic powder.
            </li>
            <li>Dip each wing in the flour mixture, crumb mixture, egg mixture then back in the crumb mixture. Drop carrot into hot oil; when it starts to fry, 
                drop in the wings. Fry about 10 minutes, or until cooked through - they'll be a deep golden colour.
